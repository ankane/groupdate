Breaking changes

- `Date` objects are now returned for day, week, month, quarter, and year by default. Use `dates: false` for the previous behavior, or change this globally with `Groupdate.dates = false`.
- Array and hash methods no longer return the entire series by default. Use `series: true` for the previous behavior.
- The `series: false` option now returns the correct types and order, and plays nicely with other options.
